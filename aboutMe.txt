A brief bio about me, iâ€™ve lived in Chicago for the past 15 years, since graduating from the University of Illinois with a degree in Political Science. I have worked in the healthcare industry, for a non profit, and in sales and am now pursuing a future in IT.

I enjoy action movies and the Bourne Trilogy is among my favorites.
